* Fix bug in Reeds and Shepp paths when curvature is not equal to 1.
* Handle LockedJoint and Implicit instances in the same container in ProblemSolver class. make method ProblemSolver::addLockedJointToConfigProjector deprecated.
* Replace class ContinuousCollisionChecking by class ContinuousValidation for broader generalisation.
* Remove deprecated methods and files

* in SteeringMethod, assert that if q1 == q2, operator() returns a path.
* class SplineGradientBased has been improved
  - some bugs have been fixed,
  - length of input path should not be 0.
* PathVector::extract(t,t) does not returns an empty path.
* InterpolatedPath supports non-zero start of interval of definition
* Add abstract class ObstacleUserInterface. This class is aimed at being parent of an class handling obstacles. Provide some implementations like
  - ObstacleUser,
  - ObstacleUserVector.
* Add method setSecurityMargin to class ObstacleUserInterface.
New in 4.6.0
* Keep frames of obstacles.
* Add Gaussian configuration shooter
* Enable computation of path derivative up to order 2 for path with time parameterization.
* Improve parameters in problem
* SimpleTimeParameterization accepts acceleration limits.

New in 4.1, 2018-05-17
* Diffusing Planner calls path projector if defined.
* ProblemSolver::directPath now calls path projector if defined.
* Implement Dubins, reverse Dubins (Snibud) steering methods
* Rewrite Reeds and Shepp steering method.
* In ProblemSolver, when loading new robot, reset obstacles.
* Move LockedJointPtr_t and JointAndShapes_t from hpp::manipulation::ProblemSolver
* Use MATHJAX for documentation generation.
* Explicit relative transformation takes values in SE3.
* Add getter to joint1 and joint2 in ExplicitRelativeTransform.
* Add k nearest neightbor search in whole roadmap.
* Implement k-PRM*.
* Implement continuousCollisionChecking::Progressive::filterCollisionPairs.
* Add accessor to the SteeringMethod::problem_.
* Add TimeParameterization and add it to Path.
* Fix loop of shared ptr of ConnectedComponent.
* member BasicConfigurationShooter is not a const reference anymore.
